==================================================================

We can extend the frequencies from available: 1m, 5min, ..., monthly, etc.
by calculating from available data. For example, for frequency 2min we can use the
available frequency 1min and combine 2 1min bars into one 2min bar.
So far this is not implemented.

===================================================================

To run the example:

$ python avan.py <json request file>

for example:

$ python avan.py config.json
